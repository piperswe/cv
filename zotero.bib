	abstract = {Vehicle insurance is a very important source of income for insurance companies, and it is closely related to the driving style performed by driving behavior. Different driving styles can better reflect the driving risk than the number of violations, claims, and other static statistic data. Subdivide the vehicle insurance market according to the personal characteristics and driving habits of the insured vehicles, and studying the personalized vehicle insurance products, will help the insurance companies to improve their income, help the drivers to change their bad driving habits, and thus help to realize the healthy development of the vehicle insurance industry. In the past 20 to 30 years, more and more insurance companies around the world have launched vehicle usage-based insurance ({UBI}) products based on driving style analysis. However, up to now, there are few comprehensive reports on commercial vehicle {UBI} products and their core driving risk assessment methods. On the basis of literature indexing on the Web of Science and other academic platforms by using the keywords involved in vehicle {UBI}, over 100 relevant works of literature were screened in this paper, and a detailed and comprehensive discussion on the driving style evaluation methods and the design of commercial vehicle {UBI} products during the past 20 to 30 years has been made, hoping to get a full understanding of the possible factors affecting driving style and the collectible data that can reflect these factors, and to get a full grasp of the developing status, challenges and future trends in vehicle insurance branch of the Internet of Vehicles ({IoV}) industry.

M. Turing." These contributions, together with commentaries from current experts in a wide spectrum of fields and backgrounds, provide insight on the significance and contemporary impact of A.M. Turing's work. Offering a more modern perspective than anything currently available, "Alan Turing: His Work and Impact" gives wide coverage of the many ways in which Turing's scientific endeavors have impacted current research and understanding of the world. His pivotal writings on subjects including computing, artificial intelligence, cryptography, morphogenesis, and more display continued relevance and insight into today's scientific and technological landscape. This collection provides a great service to researchers, but is also an approachable entry point for readers with limited training in the science, but an urge to learn more about the details of Turing's work. 2013 winner of the prestigious R.R.

Hodges tells how Turing's revolutionary idea of 1936-- the concept of a universal machine-- laid the foundation for the modern computer. Turing brought the idea to practical realization in 1945 with his electronic design. This work was directly related to Turing's leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers during World War {II}, a scientific triumph that was critical to Allied victory in the Atlantic. Despite his wartime service, Turing was eventually arrested, stripped of his security clearance, and forced to undergo a humiliating treatment program-- all for trying to live honestly in a society that defined homosexuality as a crime. This New York Times bestselling biography of the founder of computer science and artificial intelligence, with a new preface by the author that addresses Turing's royal pardon in 2013, is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life. --},

While many exception systems support abstraction, aggregation, and hierarchy (e.g., via class declaration and subclassing mechanisms), it is rare to see such expressive power in more generic effect systems. We designed an effect system around the idea of protecting system resources and incorporated our effect system into the Wyvern programming language. Similar to type members, a Wyvern object can have effect members that can abstract lower-level effects, allow for aggregation, and have both lower and upper bounds, providing for a granular effect hierarchy. We argue that Wyvern’s effects capture the right balance of expressiveness and power from the programming language design perspective. We present a full formalization of our effect-system design, showing that it allows reasoning about authority and attenuation. Our approach is evaluated through a security-related case study.},

In essence, the former refers to new traffic appearing as a result of new road construction, while the latter refers lo traffic disappearing as a result of road closure. Despite problems with the available data and their measurement, it is concluded that - with the caveats of either pre-existing congestion in the case of capacity increases or no spare capacity in the case of capacity decreases - the weight of evidence indicates that induced and suppressed traffic are indeed real phenomena. It is argued that the link between traffic and road capacity is therefore far more complex than previously understood.

Solipsism is therefore more properly regarded as the doctrine that, in principle, “existence” means for me my existence and that of my mental states. Existence is everything that I experience—physical objects, other people, events and processes—anything that would commonly be regarded as a constituent of the space and time in which I coexist with others and is necessarily construed by me as part of the content of my consciousness. For the solipsist, it is not merely the case that he believes that his thoughts, experiences, and emotions are, as a matter of contingent fact, the only thoughts, experiences, and emotions. Rather, the solipsist can attach no meaning to the supposition that there could be thoughts, experiences, and emotions other than his own. In short, the true solipsist understands the word “pain,” for example, to mean “my pain.”  He cannot accordingly conceive how this word is to be applied in any sense other than this exclusively egocentric one.},

Yet, what if the American approach to growth is the problem? What if the wealth generated by all that new investment isn't enough to support the infrastructure? That is the core premise of Strong Towns, a movement to change the way cities approach growth and development. While modern city development creates a short-term illusion of prosperity, it results in more long-term obligations than the community can handle. The Strong Towns response is a revolution in how we assemble the places we life. By shifting focus from state and federal growth initiatives towards the basic, day-to-day needs of residents, communities of all sizes can make low risk investments that simultaneously strengthen the community financially while improving quality of life"--},

Kleene and J. B. Rosser. The first four chapters present the calculus of lambda-conversion in detail, with subsequent chapters discussing the calculus of λ-K-conversion, the calculus of restricted λ-K-conversion, and the calculus of λ-δ-conversion, as well as the applications of the latter to symbolic logic. Gödel numbers are presented using simplified notation, and the fundamental Church-Rosser consistency theorem is discussed in full. This influential book is one that attracted the interest of Alan Turing—who later completed his {PhD} under Church’s supervision—and is widely credited with helping to usher in the modern age of computer science.

Building on and extending seminal work by Kling and Iacono (1988, 1995, 2001), this paper demonstrates the influences of technological action frames, particularly the productivity master frame, on automated underwriting use practices. We also show, however, that the link between frames and use patterns is not a simple one. Several framings of automated underwriting emerged over time as a result of interactions among the components of technology ensembles and between technology ensembles and social actors. These interactions can confirm or disconfirm the frames, reinforcing or eroding them and shaping new frames. Today, multiple frames and use patterns exist simultaneously in the industry. As Kling and Iacono argued, these results cannot be understood solely in terms of economic forces. At the same time, they suggest the role of the technology ensemble in technology framing and use practices. These findings enhance our understanding of the dynamics of computerization movements.},

We find evidence consistent with the claim that electoral support for third parties\&\#x2014;mainly left-wing third parties\&\#x2014;declined because the Democratic Party co-opted the left-wing policy position beginning with the passage of the New Deal agenda. We note first that most of the third-party voting in the pre-New-Deal era was for left-wing third parties and that this declined sharply during the 1930s and 1940s. We then show that after the New Deal the Democratic Party's electoral support was higher in areas that had traditionally supported left-wing third parties. Contrary to some claims in the literature, we find little support for the hypothesis that the decline of third-party voting was immediately due to electoral reforms such as the introduction of direct primaries and the Australian ballot, except possibly in the south.},

In this cohesive and wide-ranging study, Willie Thompson charts the history of the left, from its origins in the French Revolution to the present crisis. The schisms between revolution and reform which have so characterised the left and which have determined its shape as a world movement during the twentieth century, are described and analysed in detail. Thompson focuses on the principal currents, including the rise and fall of Bolshevism, Leninism and Stalinism; the embrace and subsequent abandonment of Marxist rhetoric by former Soviet allies in the Third World; European social democracy; and'actually existing socialism'in states such as China and Cuba. The impact of'alternatives'to the mainstream - Trotskyism, Maoism and Eurocommunism - is assessed, and the potential for the New Left and postwar social forces such as feminism, environmentalism and'identity'politics to facilitate renewal is evaluated. Thompson concludes that if the left is to play any part in addressing the unfinished agenda of the post-1990s, then it must develop a clear understanding of the historical lessons that follow from its earlier embodiments.},

	shorttitle = {Traffic forecasts ignoring induced demand},
	abstract = {Although the phenomenon of induced traffic has been theorized for more than 60 years and is now widely accepted among transport researchers, the traffic-generating effects of road capacity expansion are still often neglected in transport modelling. Such omission can lead to serious bias in the assessments of environmental impacts as well as the economic viability of proposed road projects, especially in situations where there is a latent demand for more road
capacity. This has been illustrated in the present paper by an assessment of travel time savings, environmental impacts and the economic performance of a proposed road project in Copenhagen with and without short-term induced traffic included in the transport model. The available transport model was not able to include long-term induced traffic resulting from changes in land use and in the level of service of public transport. Even though the model calculations included only a part of the induced traffic, the difference in cost-benefit results
compared to the model excluding all induced traffic was substantial. The results show lower travel time savings, more adverse environmental impacts and a considerably lower benefitcost ratio when induced traffic is partly accounted for than when it is ignored. By exaggerating the economic benefits of road capacity increase and underestimating its negative effects, omission of induced traffic can result in over-allocation of public money on road construction and correspondingly less focus on other ways of dealing with congestion and environmental problems in urban areas.},
